This analysis was done as part of an academic project. The purpose is to find some insights within the data and then present them.

A country in the Sub-Saharan Africa region could potentially wonder how they could control birthrate in their country. With this information, they know that birthrate is positively correlated with agriculture, and birthrate is positively correlated with infant mortality. They also know that there is an inverse relationship between GDP and agriculture, and GDP and infant mortality. Hence, to manage his/her country's birthrate, he/she could first look more deeply into how the GDP per capita of their country affects birthrate.
